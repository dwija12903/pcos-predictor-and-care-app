### Analysis üìä
This platform's machine learning and data analysis capabilities produce several valuable insights and real-world applications.[View all the Analysis here!](https://nbviewer.org/github/dwija12903/pcos-predictor-and-care-app/blob/main/analysis/pcos_prediction.ipynb)

1. **Identification of Key Factors**:
   - The model identifies key features strongly associated with PCOS diagnosis, such as:
     - Hormonal imbalances (e.g., high **AMH levels**).
     - Clinical measures (e.g., irregular cycles, high follicle count).
     - Common symptoms (e.g., weight gain, hair loss, skin darkening).

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The trained machine learning model predicts the likelihood of PCOS based on individual characteristics.
   - This helps healthcare professionals identify high-risk individuals, allowing for early interventions and preventive care.

3. **Personalized Treatment**:
   - By understanding the specific factors contributing to PCOS in each case, healthcare providers can offer **personalized treatment plans**.
   - This may include tailored lifestyle changes, medications, or interventions targeting identified risk factors.

4. **Early Diagnosis**:
   - The platform contributes to earlier diagnosis, which is critical for managing PCOS and preventing long-term complications like: **Infertility**, **Type 2 diabetes**, and **Cardiovascular disease**.

5. **Advanced Predictive Modeling**:
   - **Machine learning-based PCOS prediction** models.
   - Analysis of **feature importance** to highlight the most critical indicators driving predictions.

## Installation and Setup

### Backend Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, navigate to your project folder and clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwija12903/pcos-predictor-and-care-app.git
